## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Report via email

Send an email to: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### 4. What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
- We will work on a fix
- We will coordinate disclosure with you
- We will credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep your dependencies updated
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly review access permissions
- Report suspicious activity immediately

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all input data
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security audits
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Security Measures

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication
- Refresh token rotation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

### Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Secure headers

### Infrastructure

- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure cookie settings
- Content Security Policy
- Regular security updates
- Dependency scanning

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Private reporting** - Report vulnerabilities privately
2. **Investigation** - We investigate and validate the issue
3. **Fix development** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated release** - We release the fix and security advisory
5. **Public disclosure** - We publicly disclose the vulnerability

### Timeline

- **0-48 hours**: Initial response and triage
- **1-7 days**: Investigation and validation
- **7-30 days**: Fix development and testing
- **30+ days**: Coordinated release and disclosure

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are published in:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Project documentation
- Release notes

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Contact Information

- **Security Email**: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
